This project is made to control arduino from a website through a wired connection. This will be done by running a python web api, and receiving inputs from the website that will then be sent to arduino through serial. Additional features could include sending data from arduino to the website, and being able to control arduino from other sources other than a website like a phone.

Step 1,
Connect a python to a web-based api using flask

Step 2,
Create a serial connection with python that depends on the input from the flask

Step 3,
Connect the python serial connection to arduino
